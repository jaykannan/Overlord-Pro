# Overlord-Pro

My collection of Firmware, CAD files, Motherboard Schematics, Manuals, Printer Profiles, etc. for the Overlord / Overlord Pro 3D Delta Printers. I have create this repository in the hope it helps other owners of these 3D printers, as support is all but non-existant from Dreammaker.

Notes:

I found that the 2.3.5 firmware to be the most stable.

Todo:

Post printer profiles for various slicers

Compile new firmware to incorporate additional fixes - mainly dimensional accuracy, drop serial baud rate to work better with octopi, etc. If you have any requests please let me know :)
