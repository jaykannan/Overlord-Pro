My collection of firmware, CAD files, Motherboard Schematics, etc for the Overlord / Overlord Pro 3d Delta Printers.

Notes:

I found that the 2.3.5 firmware to be the most stable.

Todo:

Post printer profiles for various slicers

Compile new firmware to incorporate additional fixes - mainly dimensional accuracy, drop serial baud rate to work better with octop, etc
